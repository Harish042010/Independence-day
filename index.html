         <h1>  Happy Independence Day 🇮🇳 </h1>
         <p>
           In the calendar, Independence day is one of the significant essential days for all the Indians. From the Red Fort, the prime minister of our country addresses every Indian of our nation and hoists the national flag to celebrate the Independence day. Many institutions and organizations conduct a ceremony for flag hoisting in different parts of our country. All over TV and radio, we can listen to patriotic programs and songs.Children dress up like freedom fighters to pay tribute to our heroes. After flag hoisting and singing in the union, our national anthem fills our heart with great pride and enthusiasm. Independence day remarks the braveness of all the Indians who fought for our country, the struggle of our freedom fighters as well as our soldiers who protect us every day. Tri-colored kites can be seen in north India as a symbol of celebrating Independence day. Independence day fills patriotism and nationalism in the hearts of the youngsters of our country and reminds them of the sacrifices and struggles of our freedom fighters. 15th August is also known as ‘India Day’ in many countries.

        It was on August 15, 1947, when India finally received Independence after around 90 years of British rule. And today, with the efforts of many freedom fighters and revolutionaries, we proudly call ourselves the citizens of India, a country that is proudly ‘Sovereign, Democratic and Republic ’and 2024 marks India’s 77th anniversary of independence from British rule.

            One of the oldest language of the world, Tamil, was born in today's India. Which is more than 3000 years old.[61] Later, a king named Chandragupt Maurya built an empire called the Maurya Empire in 300 BC. It made most of South Asia into one whole country.[62] From 180 BC, many other countries invaded India. Even later (100 BC  AD 1100), other Indian dynasties (empires) came, including the Chalukyas, Cholas, Pallavas, and Pandyas. Southern India at that time was famous for its science, art, and writing. The Cholas of Thanjavur were pioneers at war in the seas and influenced Malaya, Borneo, Cambodia. The influence of Cholas are still noticeable in Southeast Asia.
